  This is my first real attempt at responsive design.  I have been given starter website with no breakpoints and styled for a full desktop screen. My goal is to make this website respond to different size screens while adding an off canvas design for mobile phones. I have been struggling with the implementation of the navigation for the small mobile phone, but have a good direction to head.  We'll have to see what I come up with.
